WEATHER APP

A weather app using openweather's API in order to access the weather and other related data.

HOW TO USE

Download all the neccesary files in the repository. After downloading it, install the required pakages in order to run the backend:

    Flask
    dotenv

After that, kindly make an .env file, add a variable name "API" and store the API key obtained from openweather.

After that, run the main.py file in a virtual environment in which you installed the pakages required. KINDLY USE THE LOCAL HOST LINK GIVEN BY FLASK IN THE TERMINAL, or else the code would not work.

If any errors occur, feel free to email me.

I'm working on further improvement of the app, and make it better.

The next update would focus on getting more data about the weather and improve the UI.
